    "We've already seen a glimpse of this in the training and testing code above, the steps to do it outside of the training/testing loop are similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've trained a PyTorch model, chances are you'll want to save it and export it somewhere.\n",

    "As in, you might train it on Google Colab or your local machine with a GPU but you'd like to now export it to some sort of application where others can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or maybe you'd like to save your progress on a model and come back and load it back later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For saving and loading models in PyTorch, there are three main methods you should be aware of (all of below have been taken from the [PyTorch saving and loading models guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-model-for-inference)):\n",

    "| [`torch.save`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=save#torch.save) | Saves a serialized object to disk using Python's [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. Models, tensors and various other Python objects like dictionaries can be saved using `torch.save`.  | \n",
    "| [`torch.load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=torch%20load#torch.load) | Uses `pickle`'s unpickling features to deserialize and load pickled Python object files (like models, tensors or dictionaries) into memory. You can also set which device to load the object to (CPU, GPU etc). |\n",

    "> **Note:** As stated in [Python's `pickle` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), the `pickle` module **is not secure**. That means you should only ever unpickle (load) data you trust. That goes for loading PyTorch models as well. Only ever use saved PyTorch models from sources you trust.\n"

    "1. Create a straight line dataset using the linear regression formula (`weight * X + bias`).\n",
    "  * Set `weight=0.3` and `bias=0.9` there should be at least 100 datapoints total. \n",
    "  * Split the data into 80% training, 20% testing.\n",
    "  * Plot the training and testing data so it becomes visual.\n",
    "2. Build a PyTorch model by subclassing `nn.Module`. \n",
    "  * Inside should be a randomly initialized `nn.Parameter()` with `requires_grad=True`, one for `weights` and one for `bias`. \n",
    "  * Implement the `forward()` method to compute the linear regression function you used to create the dataset in 1. \n",
    "  * Once you've constructed the model, make an instance of it and check its `state_dict()`.\n",
    "  * **Note:** If you'd like to use `nn.Linear()` instead of `nn.Parameter()` you can.\n",
    "3. Create a loss function and optimizer using `nn.L1Loss()` and `torch.optim.SGD(params, lr)` respectively. \n",
    "  * Set the learning rate of the optimizer to be 0.01 and the parameters to optimize should be the model parameters from the model you created in 2.\n",
    "  * Write a training loop to perform the appropriate training steps for 300 epochs.\n",
    "  * The training loop should test the model on the test dataset every 20 epochs.\n",
    "4. Make predictions with the trained model on the test data.\n",
    "  * Visualize these predictions against the original training and testing data (**note:** you may need to make sure the predictions are *not* on the GPU if you want to use non-CUDA-enabled libraries such as matplotlib to plot).\n",
    "5. Save your trained model's `state_dict()` to file.\n",
    "  * Create a new instance of your model class you made in 2. and load in the `state_dict()` you just saved to it.\n",
    "  * Perform predictions on your test data with the loaded model and confirm they match the original model predictions from 4.\n",
